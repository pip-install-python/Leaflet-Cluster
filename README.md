# Plotly Leaflet Scatter Map Application
This application is a powerful visualization tool that combines the capabilities of Plotly and Leaflet to render interactive scatter maps. It leverages GeoJSON data to plot points on the map, representing various locations. Upon interaction, these points reveal further details such as the name and an icon representing the location.
